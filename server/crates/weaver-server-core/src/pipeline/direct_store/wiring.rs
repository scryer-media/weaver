//! Where direct-store meets the download pipeline (plan 135, D3/D7).
//!
//! Three seams, and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. **Admission** — the first decoded segment of a job admits its RAR sets
//!    from the job spec. Sets are named and their volume-to-file mapping fixed
//!    before a byte is written, which is what the coverage barrier needs and
//!    what the completion-gated topology layer cannot give.
//! 2. **Routing** — [`Pipeline::handle_direct_decode_success`] replaces the
//!    conventional write for a direct source volume: it maps the span, writes
//!    every destination it touches in one multi-path batch, and only then
//!    records coverage, feeds live PAR2 and commits the segment.
//! 3. **Finalization / demotion** — a set whose members all pass the
//!    whole-member gate commits its partials to the extractor's destinations in
//!    archive order and is marked extracted; a set that demotes materializes its
//!    volumes from its own routed bytes (D8), persists the legacy state that
//!    replaces its coverage, and hands them to the conventional path — falling
//!    back to refetching everything only when reconstruction is impossible.
//!
//! # D7, stated as suppression points
//!
//! The routing seam returns before `persist_ready_segments`, so for a direct
//! source volume there is no physical write, **no `active_file_progress` floor
//! upsert**, and no `commit_persisted_segment`. The file-complete work it would
//! have done is re-implemented here without the parts that need a file:
//! **no completed-file row**, no whole-volume hashing, no archive re-probe and
//! no incremental-extraction dispatch. Live reporting keeps using
//! `FileAssembly`, which is source-space truth either way.
//!
//! Suppressing it *here* is not enough, because these are not the only callers:
//!
//! - `refresh_archive_state_for_completed_file` has nine callers — completion
//!   checks, PAR2 merge, RAR finalization, the job service — every one of which
//!   fires for a complete file whether or not routing suppressed its own call.
//!   It carries the rule at its own entry instead.
//! - `try_rar_extraction` is job-scoped and needs no guard: it dispatches from
//!   the archive topology, and the topology's only non-test writer is
//!   `try_update_archive_topology`, whose only non-test caller is the refresh
//!   above. A direct set therefore never enters the topology at all.
//! - The completed-file row has exactly one pipeline writer, in the conventional
//!   file-complete path the routing seam returns before.
